To install UUAG, use cabal in combination with Setup.hs

Note: you'll need the packages because UUAGC is bootstrapped:
uuagc-cabal

Note: to produce a source release, you'll need to use the
Setup.hs because cabal-install at the time is not able to
do this in combination with the cabal plugin:
--
cabal clean    # remove possible junk
ghc --make Setup.hs -o setup
./setup configure --user
./setup build
./setup sdist
--
