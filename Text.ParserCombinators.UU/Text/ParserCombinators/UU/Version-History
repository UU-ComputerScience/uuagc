 0.6.1 - January 12, 2009
     1) changed the type of insertSym such that is always succeeds, instead of using a Maybe
     2) a) removed the class Describes, and included that in Provides
        b) hence, considerable simplifications of pSym
        c) removed insertSym etc, since this is now internal to insertSym
        d) added an extra instance dealing with ranges; e.g. pSym ('a', 'z')
        e) added an extra isstance enabling pSatisfy p a = pSym (p, msg, a), 
           in which p is the predicate
                    msg the error message telling what was expected
                    a the symbol to be inserted in p does not hold

     2) all $$ -> $
 0.6.4 - January 24, 2009
